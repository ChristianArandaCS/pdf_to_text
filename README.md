This is a pdf reading script that will get all the PDF's from a path and it's sub paths turn them into indiviaul images "jpg"s,
read all barcodes and return an excel with all barcodes with the and the image they are associated with.

This is being used at the company I work for to extract data from 500+ PDF's in a couple of minutes.

This would otherwise be manual work but this is a small program to save you time and manual work.
